# üß© Blockodoku

Blockodoku is a grid-based puzzle game inspired by Sudoku and block placement mechanics. The objective is to strategically place pieces on a board to complete rows, columns, or 3√ó3 sections and earn points. Simple to learn, challenging to master!

The core gameplay revolves around placing randomly generated shapes onto a grid. You earn points by completing:

1.    Full rows

2.    Full columns

3.    Full 3√ó3 squares

## üß± Piece Placement

Click and drag one of the shapes from the bottom of the screen onto the grid. A ghost piece will appear to show where it will land before releasing.

## üß† Score System & Combos

Each completed section earns 10 points. Multiple completions at once (or in sequence) result in combo bonuses. For example, completing two at once gives 30 points (10 for the first, 20 for the second).
